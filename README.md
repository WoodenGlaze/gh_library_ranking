### What is this repo?
Hey! welcome to the repo.

This repo contains a database with scanned libraries and their vulnerabilities for the game Grey Hack.

### Usage of created database:
1. Rename any existing database files so they do not contain `.csv[number]`
2. Recreate a file with a name corresponding to the split database file
3. repeat step 2 until you've downloaded the database

A script is coming to merge databases without dataloss soon.

### Roadmap:

1. [x] Start scanning all libraries
    1a. [ ] hunt down stubborn ones.
2. [ ] Start hunting down internal libraries
